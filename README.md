# JavaCode
When i was in 5th semester, Advanced Java was the subject as syllabus for 5th sem so .I am enthusiast to learn code so our Prof Prabhu Bevinamarad sir had given a task as an assignment that the input should be the states of India and output should be in a sorted manner ( ascending and descending) then i took it as challenge and completed in 2 hrs, and this was one of the best memories of my life, but this is just simple one the most challenging was "Blooms Taxonomy" so i will be descussing about this in the next coming contributions.
